# Healium Crowdfunding Project

I completed this project in 2023 as part of the She Codes Plus program.

The project brief was to create a crowdfunding website. I chose to create a website for victims and survivors of family and domestic violence who are seeking support, such as the cost of legal fees or furniture for their new home.

A couple features I was proud of for this website include:
- The quick exit button logs out the user, redirects the exiting tab to google and opens a new window with a generic weather website. The intention for this is to assist any user in a high risk situation to safely close the website if their abuser were to be present.
- When creating a new account the user will receive a randomised username, to prevent accidental disclosure of personal identifying information that may assist perpertrators of family and domestic violence finding their victims on the website.

This project was built with:
- django rest framework
- react
- netlify for deployment
